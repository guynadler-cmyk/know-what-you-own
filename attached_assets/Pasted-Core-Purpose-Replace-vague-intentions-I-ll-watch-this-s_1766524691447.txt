Core Purpose

Replace vague intentions (“I’ll watch this stock”) with real, timed checkpoints to:

Know when to exit or re-evaluate

Stay accountable to their thesis and risk tolerance

Avoid losing track of their investments over time

✅ What to Build
1. 📌 Top-of-Page Context Copy

Replace current intro with this:

Know when to stay in. Know when to step out.
Most investors don’t plan their exits — they react emotionally or lose track entirely.
This tool lets you create structured reminders to revisit your investment plan. Build accountability, avoid regret, and protect your peace of mind.

2. 🔐 Require Email to Generate Reminders

Before generating a calendar invite (Google link or .ics file), require email input.

Make email mandatory

Add brief supporting text:

📬 Enter your email to get your reminder and calendar invite:
We’ll email you a copy of your check-in plan and track scheduled reminders privately.

Validate and store all emails and associated check-ins in a new database.

3. 💾 Create scheduled_checkup_email Database

Add a backend table or collection named:
scheduled_checkup_email

Store:

email

ticker

selected_checkins: (array of selected check-in types)

custom_message: user’s message to future self

reminder_dates: generated based on selection

created_at

This allows us to:

Monitor usage

Send follow-ups

Build toward a logged-in experience later

4. 🛠 Reminder Builder (UI)

Keep the existing UI structure:

Ticker input

Choose from check-in types:

Technical Trend

Market Comparison

Investment Thesis Review

Earnings Risk Alert (disabled for now)

Optional custom date/time

Message to future self (textarea)

Display summary of reminder schedule below.

5. 📅 Generate Calendar Events (Post-email)

Once email is entered:

Enable:

📅 Add to Google Calendar

📥 Download .ics file

Both should include:

Ticker

Selected check-in categories + checklist prompts

User’s message to future self
