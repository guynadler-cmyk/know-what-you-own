You are editing an existing Timing (Technical Analysis) implementation in the restnvest app.

⚠️ This is an incremental correction, not a rebuild.
Do NOT change routing, APIs, data fetching, or alignment logic.

The alignment bar is correct and should remain unchanged.

The goal is to fix the charts so they immediately communicate what the user should notice, without requiring interpretation.

Core Product Principle (Non-Negotiable)

We do not show information. We project judgment.
Charts must encode the intended interpretation directly into their geometry.

If a user has to think about what to look for, the chart is wrong.

Global Requirements (Apply to All Charts)

One chart = one decision-relevant conclusion

Charts must work across all market states:

Strengthening

Weakening

Sideways

Transitional

No legends

No instructional text inside charts

No axes, dates, or numeric values

Meaning must be carried by shape, direction, distance, and grouping

Color may reinforce meaning but must not be the primary carrier

TREND (PRICE STRUCTURE) — Redesign
Question this chart answers

“Are structural highs and lows stepping up, stepping down, or unresolved?”

Required changes

Reduce noise

Detect and display only structural (global) swing highs and swing lows

Expect a small number of pivots (≈3–6), not local wiggles

Separate cohorts visually

Highs and lows must NEVER share the same encoding

Example: highs = circles near top, lows = squares near bottom

The eye must group highs with highs, lows with lows automatically

Add structural projection

Create a 1-D vertical projection of highs and lows:

A simplified column or spine that shows the relative level of each high (and/or low)

This projection is the primary signal:

Lower highs → immediately visible

Higher lows → immediately visible

Compression → immediately visible

Optional context

A faint, simplified price line may remain as background context only

It must not compete with the structural projection

Hard constraints

No EMAs

No gradients

No internal captions

No requirement for the user to compare points manually

A user must instantly be able to say:

“Highs are stepping down”

“Lows are rising”

“Structure is unresolved”

without reading any text.

MOMENTUM — Redesign Using EMA Relationship (Not Histogram)
Question this chart answers

“Is short-term behavior diverging from or re-aligning with long-term behavior — and in which direction?”

Required approach

Momentum MUST be visualized as the relationship between two curves:

Short-term EMA → responsive behavior

Long-term EMA → anchoring behavior

MACD histogram or signal lines must not be shown.

Visual encoding rules

Show both curves

Long-term EMA:

Thicker

Muted

Visually stable

Short-term EMA:

Thinner

Higher contrast

Visually responsive

Emphasize the relationship

Shade the area between the two curves

Distance between curves = strength of pressure

Position relative to long-term EMA = direction of pressure

Encode change over time

Widening shaded area = pressure intensifying

Narrowing shaded area = pressure easing

Convergence / crossing = regime tension or transition

Hard constraints

No histogram bars

No third signal line

No symmetry that hides direction

The relationship must be more visually prominent than the lines themselves

A user must immediately be able to say:

“Short-term is pulling away downward”

“Pressure is easing and re-aligning”

“No clear momentum — indecision”

without explanation.

STRETCH — Redesign to Show Distance From Equilibrium
Question this chart answers

“How far is price from balance right now — is tension meaningful or mild?”

Required changes

Make equilibrium dominant

One thick, calm equilibrium line or band

This is the visual anchor of the chart

De-emphasize motion

Price movement should be subtle

Wiggles are secondary to distance

Encode tension as distance

Shade ONLY the vertical distance between price and equilibrium

Greater distance = greater tension

Minimal distance = low tension

Focus on current state

The present position should dominate the visual

Historical motion may appear faintly as context only

Hard constraints

No RSI numbers

No overbought / oversold zones

No multiple bands

No decorative gradients unrelated to distance

A user must immediately feel:

“Near balance”

or “Meaningfully stretched”

without reading the caption.

What NOT to Change

Do NOT modify data sources or APIs

Do NOT add indicators

Do NOT change alignment scoring

Do NOT add trading language or signals

Do NOT refactor component structure

This task is a visual-meaning correction, not a technical expansion.

Final Validation Test

Before completing:

Hide all explanatory text — does each chart still communicate its takeaway?

Can a non-technical user describe what to notice in one sentence?

Does the chart reduce decision ambiguity rather than increase it?

If not, simplify further.

Goal:
Charts that make the right behavior obvious — without teaching technical analysis.
