Context

You are editing the existing Timing (Technical Analysis) section of the restnvest app.

⚠️ This is an in-place refactor, not a rebuild.
Do NOT change routing, authentication (none), ticker selection flow, the alignment bar, or underlying data fetching/API wiring unless strictly necessary.

The current Timing view uses abstract diagrams (fingerprints/gauges) that feel visually inconsistent with the rest of the product and are hard for retail users to decode.

We want Timing to feel like Performance and Valuation:

card-based

status label

a quadrant map + dot marker

short plain-English explanation

“Go deeper” reveals detail charts

High-level goal

Replace the current Trend/Momentum/Stretch visuals with three “signals cards” that follow the same pattern as:

Growth Quality (Performance)

Price Discipline (Valuation)

Each TA card must have:

A clear label (Trend / Momentum / Stretch)

A status badge (e.g., Improving / Weakening / Cooling / Intensifying / Mixed)

A quadrant map with soft colored quadrants and a single dot marker

1–2 plain-English bullet signals (like “Distance from 52-week high…”)

A short paragraph explanation (“what this means”)

“Why this matters” collapsible section

“Go deeper” expands into charts and definitions (optional learning)

Layout & UI structure
A) Timing header remains

Keep:

“Assess Timing Conditions”

the explanatory text

the alignment bar (it’s good, keep unchanged)

B) Three TA cards appear below the alignment bar

Order:

Trend

Momentum

Stretch
(Optional 4th consideration — see below)

Each card should visually match existing Restnvest cards:

same padding, borders, typography, soft background tints

same dot-in-quadrant visual style as the valuation quadrant (“Stormy Peak / Sunny Discount”)

Card 1 — TREND → “Structure Quality” quadrant
User outcome

User should immediately see whether price structure is:

improving

weakening

unresolved / choppy

Data inputs (already available or derivable)

From price series:

structural highs/lows (swing pivots, noise filtered)

trend quality metrics derived from pivot sequence

Quadrant map definition

Axes must be intuitive and stated plainly:

X-axis: Highs progression

left = lower highs / weakening highs

right = higher highs / strengthening highs

Y-axis: Lows progression

bottom = lower lows / weakening lows

top = higher lows / strengthening lows

Quadrant labels (use plain English, restnvest tone):

Top-right: Strengthening structure

Top-left: Stabilizing (higher lows, highs not yet)

Bottom-right: Breakout attempt (higher highs, lows not yet)

Bottom-left: Weakening structure

Dot placement:

normalized based on recent pivot behavior (no need to show numeric values)

“Signals” pills (like valuation)

Under the status badge, show 1–2 structured signals:

“Recent highs: Lowering / Improving / Mixed”

“Recent lows: Lowering / Improving / Mixed”

No numbers. No dates.

Explanation copy

1 short paragraph explaining the structure implication in observational language:

no “buy/sell”

no “entry”

no “signal”

just “conditions suggest…”

Go deeper content (Trend)

When user expands “Go deeper”:

show an artistic, simplified price structure chart:

minimal price line

only global swing highs/lows

faint connecting structure

no axis labels by default

add a short “How to read” (2–3 bullets)

optional toggle inside deeper view: “show dates / show values” (OFF by default)

Card 2 — MOMENTUM → “Pressure Balance” quadrant
User outcome

User should understand whether:

short-term pressure is forcing change (dragging long-term)

long-term is absorbing pressure (pulling short-term back)

momentum is mixed/unclear

Data inputs

Use EMA dynamics (not histogram-first):

short EMA slope / direction

long EMA slope / direction

separation trend (widening vs narrowing)

Quadrant map definition

Axes are relationship-first, not indicator-first:

X-axis: Short-term pressure direction

left = downward pressure

right = upward pressure

Y-axis: Long-term baseline direction

bottom = long-term weakening

top = long-term strengthening

Quadrant labels:

Top-right: Momentum aligned (supportive)

Top-left: Pullback within strength (absorbing)

Bottom-right: Early recovery (short improving, long weak)

Bottom-left: Pressure building (misaligned)

Dot placement:

based on current short/long slopes, plus how separation is changing (widening vs narrowing influences how “deep” into quadrant)

“Signals” pills

Under badge, show 1–2 signals:

“Short-term pressure: Improving / Weakening / Flat”

“Long-term baseline: Improving / Weakening / Flat”
Optional third:

“Pressure gap: Widening / Narrowing”

Explanation copy

Plain language describing dominance:

“Short-term is still pressing against the long-term…” or

“Pressure is being absorbed…” etc.

Go deeper content (Momentum)

When expanded:

show the “artistic” EMA relationship chart:

two curves (short vs long)

shaded region between them (distance)

minimal axis noise

include a small legend only in deeper mode:

“Short-term” / “Long-term”

include a micro “How to read” (2 bullets max)

Card 3 — STRETCH → “Distance from Balance” quadrant
User outcome

User instantly sees:

how far from balance price is

whether it’s moving toward balance or away

Data inputs

Pick one consistent internal measure (avoid RSI jargon on surface):

normalized distance from equilibrium (e.g., z-score vs 50/200, or RSI-derived stretch normalized 0–1)

direction of stretch change (moving toward equilibrium vs away)

Quadrant map definition

Axes:

X-axis: Distance from balance

left = near balance

right = far from balance

Y-axis: Direction

bottom = moving further away (stretch increasing)

top = moving back toward balance (stretch easing)

Quadrant labels:

Top-left: Calm / balanced

Top-right: Stretch easing (tension cooling)

Bottom-right: Stretch building (tension rising)

Bottom-left: Drifting (low conviction)

Dot placement:

uses current distance and recent change rate

“Signals” pills

Under badge:

“Distance from balance: Low / Moderate / High”

“Direction: Returning / Moving away / Flat”

Explanation copy

Use pendulum framing but stay plain:

“Tension is elevated, but easing…” or

“Tension is building…” etc.

Go deeper content (Stretch)

When expanded:

show a simplified stretch chart:

one line (stretch metric) with an equilibrium band

minimal scale

highlight current region

include “How to read” (2 bullets)

Optional 4th Timing Consideration (add if feasible)

Add a fourth card only if it fits cleanly:

“Volatility / Choppiness” (Market Noise)

Purpose: retail users confuse noise with opportunity.

Possible approach:

X-axis: volatility level (low→high)

Y-axis: trend clarity (clear→choppy)
Quadrants:

Clear & calm (best)

Clear but volatile

Choppy but calm

Choppy & volatile (worst)

If adding this increases complexity or distracts, skip it for now.

Guided view redefinition

Replace the current “Guided view” behavior.

Guided view should NOT merely show the question text.

It should:

add short “How to read this” callouts within each card, in the same style as tooltips/help icons in valuation/performance

show a small “?” icon next to the quadrant title; clicking reveals 2–3 bullets:

what the axes mean

how to interpret the dot position

Guided view ON:

axis labels visible (simple)

quadrant labels visible

“?” tooltips enabled by default

Guided view OFF:

axis labels simplified/hidden

only quadrant names remain

“?” tooltips still accessible but not expanded

No user accounts; do not persist state beyond session.

Style requirements

Must visually match existing restnvest sections:

same spacing, soft quadrant fills, rounded corners

dot marker style consistent with valuation quadrant (ring + center)

status chips consistent with existing risk/caution/sensible styling

keep everything calm, observational, not urgent

Avoid:

“trader” aesthetics

dense chart elements

numeric overload

Content / compliance constraints

No trading instructions:

no “good entry”

no “buy”

no “sell”

no “signal”

no “confirm”

Allowed:

“supportive”

“mixed”

“patience”

“conditions suggest”

“pressure easing/building”

“moving toward balance/away”

Final acceptance criteria

A retail investor should be able to:

read each card’s state without opening Go deeper

understand the quadrant dot with minimal help

feel the Timing section belongs to the same product as Valuation & Performance

use Go deeper only when curious, not required to understand
