You are editing the existing Timing/TA stage in our app (the Trend/Momentum/Stretch tabbed layout + quadrant cards). Do not rewrite the page from scratch. Keep the current layout, styling system, components, and data flow. We are only redesigning the Stretch visualization + copy + chip logic so it becomes intuitive, consistent with the other quadrants, and faithful to RSI.

Goal

Rebuild Stretch so a retail investor can understand it immediately without already knowing RSI, while still being technically correct.

We want Stretch to communicate:

State (how one-sided price action has been lately)

Hint to direction (is it becoming more one-sided or easing back toward balance)

Practical investor takeaway (more “watch / prepare / consider trimming” vs vague language)

Key concept (must guide UI + copy)

Explain RSI like this:

“RSI is a ‘who’s winning lately?’ scoreboard. Over the last ~14 periods, up moves are ‘wins’ and down moves are ‘losses’. Bigger moves score more. RSI compares the average size of wins vs losses.
High RSI means wins have dominated lately; low RSI means losses have dominated.”

Overbought / Oversold should be the primary words. Avoid “Zone”, “Softening”, “Direction: Falling”, etc.

A) Stretch card — keep the quadrant pattern
1) Layout / consistency requirements

Keep the same two-column quadrant + explanation panel layout as Trend and Momentum.

Keep the same “tab-like” summary cards above (Trend / Momentum / Stretch) and selection behavior.

Keep the same general colors / rounded card style, same spacing, same typography.

Keep “Go deeper” affordance consistent.

2) Replace the current Stretch visualization with a quadrant that matches our design system

We want a 2x2 quadrant (like the other sections), but with RSI-driven axes:

Axes

X-axis: “One-sidedness (RSI level)”

Left side represents Loss-dominant conditions (RSI < 50)

Right side represents Win-dominant conditions (RSI > 50)

The axis should visually indicate the important landmarks:

Oversold threshold: 30

Balance center: 50

Overbought threshold: 70

Don’t show raw numbers as the main thing, but subtle tick labels “30 / 50 / 70” are ok.

Y-axis: “Pressure shift (heating vs cooling)”

Top = Cooling toward balance (one-sidedness is easing)

Bottom = Heating away from balance (one-sidedness is intensifying)

The key is relative to balance, not “RSI up/down” in isolation.

Quadrant labels (must be plain English, investor-intuitive)

Use these exact 4 labels (or extremely close):

Top-left (Loss-dominant + Cooling): “Bounce setup”

Bottom-left (Loss-dominant + Heating): “Still sliding”

Top-right (Win-dominant + Cooling): “Cooling off”

Bottom-right (Win-dominant + Heating): “Overheating”

These labels should be visible in the quadrant the way other sections show labels (subtle but readable).

Dot position

The dot should reflect current RSI and current heating/cooling:

X position maps from RSI value (0–100) across the quadrant width. Ensure that RSI=50 is centered.

Y position maps from a “heating/cooling score” described below.

Keep the dot styling consistent with other quadrants (teal ring + filled center, etc.).

B) Stretch chips — make them RSI-native and meaningful

Replace the current Stretch chips with exactly these two chips (and an optional third “context” chip):

Chip 1: RSI Level

Label: “RSI: Oversold / Balanced / Overbought”

Oversold: RSI <= 30

Overbought: RSI >= 70

Balanced: 30 < RSI < 70

Color: Oversold/Overbought should look like “attention / caution” states; Balanced should look calm/neutral.

Chip 2: Pressure shift

Label: “Pressure: Heating / Cooling / Flat”
This describes whether RSI is moving toward balance (50) or away from balance (more one-sided).

Optional Chip 3: Investor context

Label should be something like “Investor cue” with one of:

“Prepare to buy (early)” when Oversold + Cooling

“Wait” when Oversold + Heating

“Prepare to trim” when Overbought + Cooling

“Caution” when Overbought + Heating

For Balanced: usually “Neutral” unless pressure is strongly Heating or Cooling (then “Watch”).

If adding this third chip makes the UI too busy, keep it for the “details panel” text instead.

Important: Never use “Zone” or “Direction” terminology in Stretch.

C) Compute “Heating vs Cooling” correctly (deterministic + explainable)

Implement a deterministic method so results always line up with the chips and summary:

Inputs

RSI series (same timeframe user selected: default weekly, optional daily if already implemented)

Use the standard RSI lookback already used (likely 14). Keep existing RSI calc if correct.

Derived values

Distance from balance: d = RSI - 50

Change in distance: compare now vs a short lookback (e.g., 3 periods):

d_now = RSI_now - 50

d_prev = RSI_prev - 50 (prev = N periods ago, e.g., 3)

delta = abs(d_now) - abs(d_prev)

Classify pressure shift

If delta > +threshold => Heating (moving away from balance)

If delta < -threshold => Cooling (moving toward balance)

Else => Flat

Pick a reasonable threshold so it doesn’t flip constantly (e.g., 1–3 RSI points depending on timeframe). Weekly should be less noisy; daily might need a slightly higher threshold.

Y-position mapping

Use delta (or a smoothed version) to place the dot vertically:

Cooling => dot above center line

Heating => dot below center line

Flat => near center

Clamp extremes so the dot stays within the quadrant.

This ensures “heating/cooling” is mathematically tied to “one-sidedness intensifying/easing”.

D) Replace Stretch summary text so it can’t contradict chips

The Stretch panel headline + summary sentence must be generated from chip outcomes (not ad-hoc phrasing).

Title format

Stretch
Status pill should be one of:

Bounce setup

Still sliding

Cooling off

Overheating

Neutral (only when very close to balance AND Flat)

Summary sentence (examples; build exact mapping)

Oversold + Cooling: “Losses have dominated lately, but that pressure is easing — rebounds become more likely.”

Oversold + Heating: “Losses are still dominating and intensifying — patience may be warranted.”

Overbought + Cooling: “Wins have dominated lately, but momentum is easing — pullback risk is rising.”

Overbought + Heating: “Wins are dominating and intensifying — conditions look stretched and fragile.”

Balanced + Cooling/Heating: “Conditions are near balance, but pressure is [heating/cooling] — stay alert.”

No vague words like “softening”. Always connect the meaning back to wins vs losses dominance.

E) Guided view needs to teach the visuals (not remove the question only)

We previously mis-implemented Guided view. Fix Stretch so Guided view actually helps:

When Guided view = ON

Show a compact “How to read this” box inside Stretch (consistent style with the rest of the app), with 3 bullets max:

RSI = scoreboard: “High = wins dominated lately. Low = losses dominated.”

Left vs right: “Left = losses dominating. Right = wins dominating.”

Top vs bottom: “Top = pressure easing back toward balance. Bottom = pressure intensifying.”

When Guided view = OFF

Hide that box entirely (keep only the quadrant + chips + summary).

Do NOT remove the main question header above the card as the only Guided view change — Guided view must explain the visual encoding.

F) Acceptance checks (must pass)

Stretch uses the same quadrant pattern as Trend/Momentum (2x2 grid + dot + labeled regions).

Chips are RSI-native: RSI Level + Pressure (and optional investor cue). No “Zone”.

Summary never contradicts chips (derive from deterministic mapping).

Overbought/oversold is explicitly supported:

Oversold can imply “prepare to buy (early)” only when cooling.

Overbought can imply “prepare to trim” only when cooling.

Guided view actually teaches what the dot and axes mean.
