We’ve already built a basic version of “Protect What You Own” in Stage 6 — it lets users schedule a calendar reminder for a check-in on their stock. Now we want to upgrade that into a flexible, educational, and customizable exit plan assistant.

✅ GOAL:

Allow users to choose a check-in type, preview what it includes, configure the reminder time/date, and receive a calendar invite with a detailed checklist based on their selection.

🔧 Functional Requirements:
1. Add a Section: “Choose Your Check-In Type”

Users can select from predefined reminder categories. Each should have:

A title

A short description

A collapsible preview of checklist items (“What you’ll review”)

A checkbox to select the type

📘 Categories (Starter Set):

📈 Technical Trend Check (Short-Term)
Is the trend your friend?
Preview:

Are you seeing higher highs or lower lows?

Has the trend reversed or is it intact?

Are moving averages aligned?

Is volume increasing or fading?

📊 Market Comparison (Mid-Term)
Compare how your stock performs against the broader market.
Preview:

Has it outperformed or underperformed the S&P 500?

Are there reasons for the divergence?

Is this underperformance a risk or an opportunity?

💡 Investment Thesis Review (Long-Term)
Revisit why you bought the stock in the first place.
Preview:

Is your original reason for investing still valid?

Has company leadership changed direction?

Has valuation become stretched or more compelling?

🛎️ Earnings Risk Alert
Check in before or after earnings to prepare or reflect.
Preview:

Is the stock volatile around earnings?

Do you expect good/bad news?

What will change your mind about this company?

2. Let users configure:

⏰ Custom date & time for the reminder

✅ Multiple types can be selected (e.g., Technical + Thesis Review)

3. Include a text area: “Message to Your Future Self” (Optional)
📅 Reminder Creation Flow

When the user is done configuring:

“Preview Reminder” → shows the checklist for selected type(s)

“Send to Calendar”:

Opens email capture modal (“Where should we send your check-up guide?”)

Once submitted, send user:

A calendar invite (.ics or Google Calendar)

Checklist items for their selected type(s)

Their note to future self

📤 Tech Notes:

No new page — this must extend the existing Stage 6 Protect What You Own screen

Checklist logic can live in a config file or local JSON object

Keep styles consistent with the existing UI (Tailwind)

Use React hooks for managing selected types and email capture

For email, use Resend, EmailJS, or similar

🧠 Optional Enhancements (nice to have):

Save user email + reminder config to a lightweight backend or Google Sheet

Include a smart suggested date/time based on:

Earnings calendar (if ticker + earnings data is available via API)

1-week or 1-month timeframes by default

Let users “test” reminder: open a sample .ics or Google invite in preview mode
