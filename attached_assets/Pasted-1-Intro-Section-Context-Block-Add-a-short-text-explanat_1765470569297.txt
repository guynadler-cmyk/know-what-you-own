1. Intro Section (Context Block)

Add a short text explanation at the top, like this:

You’ve seen what this business does. Now let’s look under the hood — is it financially strong enough to own?

We’ll guide you through revenue, earnings, cash flow, debt, and reinvestment — to help you decide if this is a business worth holding long term.


Use soft tones, a small “info” icon, and max 2 paragraphs. Keep it friendly and direct.

✳️ 2. Hover Definitions for Financial Terms

For every financial term shown (e.g. FCF, Debt, CAPEX), implement a hover tooltip with plain-English, non-jargon explanations.

Examples:

FCF (Free Cash Flow) → “The money left after the business pays its bills and reinvests. Real money it can keep or use.”

Debt → “What the company owes. Some is fine, too much is risky.”

CAPEX → “Spending to grow or maintain the business — like new equipment or upgrades.”

Use Tailwind tooltips or custom hover boxes — mobile-friendly on long-press.

✳️ 3. Quadrant Viewer Updates

Use the existing quadrant design (one at a time, navigable from summary cards), but make these changes:

A. Update Debt Safety Quadrant logic:

Fix misleading colors and labels. Use this logic:

Quadrant Label	Position	Color
Financially Fragile	High debt, low earnings	🔴 Red
Healthy Leverage	Moderate debt, strong earnings	🟢 Green
Underleveraged	Low debt, low return	🟡 Yellow
Aggressive Borrower	High debt, high return	🟠 Orange

Update axis labels to:

Y-axis: Debt Levels (Low to High)

X-axis: Return / Earnings Strength (Low to High)

Add quadrant label text inside the chart space for clarity.

✳️ 4. Final Summary Block ("What This Tells Us")

Add a box at the bottom of Stage 2, styled like a callout card.

Content example:

🧠 Financial Summary:

This business is generating stable revenue, turning profit into cash, and managing debt wisely. That’s the foundation of long-term resilience.

But remember: there are thousands of public companies. Sensible investing means being picky — and passing when a business doesn’t meet your bar.

Would you feel confident owning this for the next decade?

✅ If yes, move forward.  
🚫 If not, pass with confidence — and keep looking.

✳️ 5. Call to Action Buttons (User-Driven Decision)

Below the summary, place two action buttons:

✅ “Add to Plan” — moves to next phase

🚫 “Pass with Confidence” — dismisses and logs this as a declined opportunity

Both should be soft buttons (no pressure), styled with Tailwind (rounded-xl, soft shadows, hover states).

🎨 Design Notes

Use light gray or soft cream backgrounds (bg-gray-50, bg-neutral-100)

Rounded edges, consistent spacing

Avoid harsh reds/greens — keep tones pastel and professional

Mobile-responsive grid for summary cards and quadrant navigation

All elements should feel like part of a cohesive, guided flow
