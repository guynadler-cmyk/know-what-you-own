You are working on an existing implementation of the Timing (Technical Analysis) stage in the restnvest app.

This task is not a rebuild.

You must:

Preserve existing structure, components, and data logic

Modify and enhance visuals and clarity

Improve communication without adding complexity

Assume:

Trend, Momentum, and Stretch logic already exists

Alpha Vantage integration already exists

The page renders correctly today

Your job is to make the meaning obvious at a glance.

Primary Issues to Fix
1. Alignment / “Wait” Indicator Is Unclear

The current red marker under the verdict does not communicate:

What it represents

Whether higher or lower is better

How it relates to the verdict

Required Fix

Replace the ambiguous marker with an explicit Market Alignment Indicator.

Requirements:

Clearly shows a spectrum from Weak → Strong

Clearly marks the current position

Visually indicates that higher alignment is better

Subtle color progression (red → yellow → green)

No numbers required

This indicator must visually reinforce the verdict:

“Conditions suggest waiting for more clarity”

A user should understand this without reading any text.

Chart Refinement: From Illustration → Explanation

The charts are visually clean but still require users to read text to understand them.

This must change.

Each chart must visually communicate its conclusion at a glance.

Text should confirm, not explain.

Trend Chart: Make Structure Unmistakable
Current Issue

The price structure is aesthetically pleasing but ambiguous.
Lower highs / lower lows are not visually explicit.

Required Changes

Without adding numbers or clutter:

Add explicit visual markers:

Subtle dots or ticks on swing highs and lows

Light, sloping guide lines connecting highs and lows

Make direction unavoidable:

If structure is weakening, the eye should clearly see downward stepping

If stabilizing, flattening should be obvious

Add a light, embedded label inside the chart area:

Example: “Price structure: lower highs, lower lows”

Constraints:

No axes

No dates

No candlesticks

No numeric values

This chart should explain trend without text below it.

Momentum Chart: Emphasize Pressure, Not Symmetry
Current Issue

The chart looks balanced and requires explanation to interpret pressure.

Required Changes

Introduce visual asymmetry:

Selling pressure should feel heavier than buying pressure

Red areas thicker or denser than green when applicable

Add a directional flow cue:

Subtle slope, gradient, or motion indicating pressure direction over time

Keep it abstract:

No MACD lines

No signal lines

No numeric scale

A user should immediately feel:

“Selling pressure is dominant and not easing yet.”

Stretch Chart: Make Tension Obvious
Current Issue

Equilibrium exists but is too subtle; tension is not immediately felt.

Required Changes

Make the equilibrium line unmistakable:

Slightly thicker, glowing, or clearly labeled “Equilibrium”

Emphasize distance from equilibrium:

Visual shading or vertical distance highlighting

The eye should notice “how far” price is from balance

De-emphasize movement noise:

Focus on tension, not oscillation detail

The chart should visually answer:

“Is price stretched, and is that tension resolving?”

Global Visual Rule (Critical)

For every chart:

If all explanatory text were removed except the title, a smart user should still understand the conclusion.

If not, refine the visuals further.

What NOT to Change

Do not change data sources

Do not change alignment logic

Do not add indicators

Do not add numbers, axes, or timestamps

Do not refactor architecture

Do not add trading features or terminology

This is a communication upgrade, not a technical one.

Final Validation Checklist

Before considering this task complete, confirm:

The alignment indicator clearly shows why the verdict is “wait”

Each chart communicates its message visually first

Text reads as reassurance, not instruction

The page feels calmer and clearer than before

This feature exists to slow users down, not make them feel clever.
