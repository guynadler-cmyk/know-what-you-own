Context

You are editing an existing Timing (Technical Analysis) section in the restnvest app.

⚠️ This is an edit of existing work, not a rebuild.
Do not change routing, data sources, API calls, alignment logic, or verdict text.

The current implementation experimented with abstract charts, but retail users cannot decode them without guidance.
Your task is to replace time-series charts with judgment-first visual objects and add an always-on guided mode that trains users how to read them.

Core Product Principle (Non-Negotiable)

We do not show market information.
We help users recognize conditions.

No trading language.
No signals.
No entries.
No “buy / sell / confirmation”.

Every visual must answer a single question immediately.

PART 1 — Guided View (Required)
Global behavior

Add a “Guided view” toggle at the top of the Timing section.

Default: ON

User can toggle OFF at any time

No persistence required (stateless product)

When ON:

Each section shows one explicit question that tells the user what to look for

Subtle visual cues may appear to reinforce attention

When OFF:

All guidance text and cues disappear

Visuals remain clean and minimal

PART 2 — Replace Charts with Judgment-First Visual Objects
1️⃣ Trend — Structural Fingerprint (Replace price chart entirely)
User question (shown when Guided view = ON)

Are structural highs and lows improving, deteriorating, or unresolved?

What to remove

Continuous price line

Candles

Short-term waves

Any “current price” emphasis

What to render instead

A structural fingerprint, consisting of:

Two vertical sequences side-by-side:

Highs

Lows

Each sequence shows only globally significant pivots

No time axis, no price axis

No connecting lines

Rules

Never treat the most recent data point as a confirmed pivot

Reduce pivot count aggressively (noise filtered)

Highs and lows must be visually distinct (shape or color)

Add a small label above:
“Structure view (~6 months)”

Goal

User should identify structure direction in under 1 second, without interpreting price.

2️⃣ Momentum — Relationship Diagram (Replace waveform / MACD-style chart)
User question (Guided view = ON)

Is short-term pressure forcing change, or being absorbed by the long-term?

What to remove

Waveforms

Histograms

Oscillations

Time-series momentum plots

What to render instead

A relationship diagram that shows dominance:

A stable long-term reference (fixed position)

A mobile short-term reference

Visible distance between them

How meaning is conveyed

Increasing separation → short-term forcing change

Decreasing separation → long-term absorbing pressure

Flat / ambiguous → neutral

Visual constraints

No history

No curves

No numeric values

No snapping to “now”

Optional (Guided view only)

A single, subtle animation on load showing the direction of dominance
(fade or gentle drift only, ≤500ms)

3️⃣ Stretch — Balance Gauge (Replace RSI / oscillation chart)
User question (Guided view = ON)

How far from balance are we — and are we moving toward it or away?

What to remove

RSI line charts

Oscillation history

Overbought / oversold language

What to render instead

A balance gauge:

Central equilibrium zone

Single marker showing current state

Subtle directional hint (arrow or gradient)

Rules

State is primary, direction is secondary

No thresholds

No historical path dominating the view

Goal

User instantly understands tension + direction, not timing.

PART 3 — Tone, Animation, and Restraint
Animation

Calm, minimal transitions (300–500ms)

Opacity fades, gentle motion only

No bounce, no emphasis, no urgency

Copy constraints

Allowed:

“Structure”

“Pressure”

“Balance”

“Alignment”

Forbidden:

Entry

Buy / Sell

Signal

Ideal time

Confirmation

Prediction

Final Validation Checklist

Before marking complete, verify:

Each section answers its question in <1 second

No visual requires prior TA knowledge

Guided view teaches where to look, not what to do

Turning Guided view OFF results in a clean, calm interface

The section feels observational, not reactive

Success Criteria

If a retail investor can say:

“Structure looks weak”

“Momentum is still fighting the long-term”

“Price is stretched but easing”

…without seeing a single traditional chart — the task is complete.

Final answer to your question

Yes — we’re ready.
You’ve done the hard work: clarifying intent, rejecting noise, and committing to a coherent visual language.

At this point, the only way forward is exactly this:
one strong prompt, then evaluate execution — not concepts.
