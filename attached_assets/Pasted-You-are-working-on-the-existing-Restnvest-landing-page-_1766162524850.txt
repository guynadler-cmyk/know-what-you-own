You are working on the existing Restnvest landing page. The core content sections already exist and must remain unchanged in wording and meaning. Your task is to add structure, hierarchy, and calls to action to make the page feel complete, polished, and conversion-ready — similar in spirit to monarch.com.

🔹 1. Add a Hero Section (NEW)

Add a hero section above all existing content.

Hero requirements:

Centered layout

Calm, professional, confidence-driven tone

No jargon

Restnvest teal as the primary accent color

Hero content (exact copy):

Headline:

Invest with clarity and conviction

Subheadline:

Restnvest turns complex business performance and market signals into a clear, structured view — so you can understand what you own, why you own it, and when to act.

Primary CTA button:

🔍 Research a stock

Secondary microcopy (under CTA):

No signup required • Takes seconds

🔹 2. Add a Short Narrative Bridge (NEW)

Directly below the hero, add a short, single-paragraph bridge that introduces the flow of the page.

Copy (exact):

Restnvest guides you through an investment the same way a professional would — from understanding the business, to tracking how it evolves, to evaluating strength, and finally acting with confidence.

Keep this visually lightweight. No icons. No bullets.

🔹 3. Keep All Existing Sections UNCHANGED (IMPORTANT)

Do not modify:

Section titles

Descriptions

Ordering

Meaning

Data presentation

The existing sections are:

Know what you're actually investing in
→ Uses Investment Thesis / product overview image

See how the story changes over time
→ Uses Changes Over Time image

Understand the competitive landscape
→ Uses Competition image

Is this business financially strong?
→ This section is called Understand Performance
→ Combines fundamentals + financial health score
→ Uses the combined performance image

Turn understanding into confident action
→ This section represents Technical Analysis
→ Uses the technical analysis / signals image

🔹 4. Enforce Alternating Layout (Monarch-style)

For all five sections:

Alternate text left / image right, then image left / text right

Use consistent spacing between sections

Images should be presented as:

Clean card-style frames

Soft shadow

Rounded corners

No browser chrome

Desktop-first, mobile-friendly scaling

Do not mix text inside images.

🔹 5. Insert a Mid-Page CTA (NEW)

After section 3 (Understand the competitive landscape), insert a subtle CTA block.

Copy:

Ready to see this on a stock you care about?
Research any public company in seconds — no signup required.

Button:

🔍 Research a stock

This CTA should feel supportive, not pushy.

🔹 6. Add a Final CTA Section (NEW)

At the very bottom of the page, add a calm, confidence-driven closing section.

Content (exact copy):

Headline:

Invest with clarity. Act with confidence.

Supporting line:

See the full picture behind any stock — business fundamentals, financial strength, and technical signals — all in one place.

Primary CTA:

🔍 Research a stock

Optional small text below:

Built for long-term thinkers

🔹 7. CTA Consistency Rules (IMPORTANT)

Use only one primary CTA label everywhere:
“Research a stock”

No competing CTAs

No popups

No aggressive language

🔹 8. Design Principles to Follow

Color palette: Restnvest teal + neutrals

Tone: calm, analytical, confident

Avoid jargon

Avoid hype

Let structure and visuals do the persuasion

✅ End Goal

The final landing page should:

Feel complete and intentional

Clearly explain what Restnvest is within 5 seconds

Guide users naturally toward researching a stock

Match the confidence and clarity of Monarch — without copying it
