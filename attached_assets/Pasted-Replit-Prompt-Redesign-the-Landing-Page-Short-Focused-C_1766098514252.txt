Replit Prompt: Redesign the Landing Page (Short, Focused, Conversion-Oriented)

Redesign our landing page as a clean, modern, one-screen experience focused on encouraging users to run their first company analysis.

🎯 GOAL:

Help users understand why restnvest exists, how it helps, and make it easy to trigger their first analysis — without getting lost in explanation or visual noise.

🧱 STRUCTURE & CONTENT:
1. Hero Section

Headline:
Most tools give you charts. We give you clarity.

Subheadline:
Restnvest turns investing into a simple, structured workflow — so you know what you own, why you own it, and what to do next.

CTA Button:
Try it instantly →
(scrolls or jumps to the ticker input)

2. Ticker Input Section (Primary Action Block)

A visually prominent input form:

Label or prompt: Enter a ticker (e.g., AAPL, TSLA)

Input field + Analyze button

Subtext below input:
No sign-up needed. Just instant insight.

3. What You’ll Get (Preview Block)

Use a card-style section that previews the output of the analysis.

Heading: What you’ll get in seconds

Bullet-style or pill-style list:

Strategic themes

Market size

Competitive edge

Risks & red flags

Business model

Key metrics

Competitors

Recent changes

You can also show a mock “AI Analysis Card” (placeholder style) if visual space allows.

4. Why It Matters (Philosophy Block)

Headline:
Information isn’t insight. Clarity builds conviction.

Text:
Most investors give up not because they’re wrong — but because they never understood what they owned in the first place.
Restnvest helps you invest in businesses, not tickers — with a clear process you can actually stick with.

5. Final Call to Action

Repeat the input form or CTA at the bottom:

Start your first analysis now →
Same form, or scroll link.

🎨 DESIGN NOTES

Keep the layout minimal and focused. Use generous spacing, max-w-3xl, centered text, and clean sans-serif typography.

Use soft background accents (bg-gray-50, bg-white, shadow-sm, rounded-xl) to organize sections.

Use Tailwind classes and responsive layout (flex, grid, md: breakpoints).

Avoid carousels or nav bars — one-screen experience.
