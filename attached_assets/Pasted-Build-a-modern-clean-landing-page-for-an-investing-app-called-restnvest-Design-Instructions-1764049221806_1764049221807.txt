Build a modern, clean landing page for an investing app called "restnvest".

🖼️ Design Instructions

Layout: vertical scrolling, clear section breaks, full-width hero.

Spacing: generous white space between sections (like Stripe, Linear, or Notion’s websites).

Fonts: use Inter, Open Sans, or SF Pro for clarity.

Colors: calming palette — light background (white or off-white), cool accents (navy, sage, slate, or warm neutrals).

Mobile responsive: Must stack well and keep CTA visible.

Use TailwindCSS or standard CSS flex/grid layout.

No animations required, but allow for smooth scroll/jump to sections.

🧱 Sections to Include
1. Hero Section

Headline: “Sensible investing beats optimal — because you’ll actually stick with it.”

Subheadline: “Information isn’t enough. Action builds wealth. Sustainable habits keep it growing.”

CTA Button: “→ Try Restnvest” (scrolls to demo or signup)

Optional: add a background illustration or soft gradient

2. Problem Section

Headline: “Most investing advice is built for theory. Not for humans.”

Bullets:

Institutions optimize for averages. But people don’t live in averages.

What’s ‘optimal’ is often fragile in real life — too abstract, too volatile, too hard to stick with.

Retail investors get stuck in churn. The industry keeps winning.

3. Restnvest Approach Section

Headline: “Sensible > Optimal”

Description: “Restnvest turns investing into a process you can actually follow — not a guessing game.”

Visual: Horizontal list or grid of 5 icons or steps (with icons or placeholder images)

Understand the business

Evaluate the deal

Plan your investment

Make your move

Protect what you own

4. Product Demo Section

Headline: “What the app actually does”

Use 4–5 placeholder images (we’ll replace with app screenshots).

Under each image, a caption:

“See how the company makes money”

“Evaluate value vs price”

“Set your entry and exit rules”

“Track your portfolio with logic, not emotion”

5. Audience Section

Headline: “Built for people who want to build wealth — not chase hype.”

3 blocks/icons for:

Professionals managing family wealth

First-time long-term investors

Business owners without retirement plans

6. Why It Works

Headline: “Compounding only works if you stay invested.”

Bullets:

Avoid panic selling

Stick with winners

Build habits that compound

Own companies, not tickers

7. Call to Action (CTA) Section

Headline: “Start investing sensibly”

CTA Button: “→ Try Restnvest”

Optional: small FAQ or quote/testimonial placeholder below

🧩 Functionality & Behavior

Anchor links from nav to each section

Sticky nav bar (optional)

Responsive layout for mobile/tablet

Replaceable image assets

Simple page structure: no login, no product backend — just static site for now
