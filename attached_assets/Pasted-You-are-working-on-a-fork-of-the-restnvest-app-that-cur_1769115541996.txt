You are working on a fork of the restnvest app that currently has no technical analysis and instead shows a “Coming Soon” page.

This fork must implement the Timing stage of the restnvest investment workflow.

restnvest follows a sensible investing philosophy:

We do not predict the future

We do not give buy/sell signals

We help users understand market conditions

Technical analysis is used only to assess timing conditions, not to trade

This feature must slow users down, reduce emotional decision-making, and integrate cleanly with the restnvest workflow.

High-Level Product Change
1. Workflow Order Change (Critical)

Update the investment workflow order as follows:

Old order:
4. Strategy
5. Timing

New order:
4. Timing
5. Strategy

Rationale:

We first assess market conditions (Timing)

Only then do we decide how to enter (Strategy)

This change must be reflected consistently in:

Navigation

Step labels

Internal routing

Any step index references

Timing Stage: Product Definition

The Timing stage answers one question only:

“Are market conditions currently aligned enough to act with patience?”

It does not:

Predict prices

Recommend buying or selling

Suggest entry points or targets

UI Structure (Timing Page)
Top Section: Verdict Banner

Display a single, human-readable verdict:

Examples:

“We’d wait for stronger alignment”

“Conditions are improving, but not there yet”

“Conditions look supportive”

This verdict is derived from signal alignment, not any single indicator.

Include a short subtitle:

“These signals describe current market conditions — not the future.”

Signal Categories (Three Only)

The Timing stage evaluates exactly three dimensions:

Trend – market structure

Momentum – buying vs selling pressure

Stretch – how extended price is vs equilibrium

Each category should display:

A status chip (e.g. Red / Yellow / Green)

A short one-line interpretation

An expandable “Go deeper” option

No numerical values shown by default.

Visual-First Design Requirement

The default view must be visual, not textual.

Text explanations should be:

Secondary

Collapsible

Supportive, not dominant

Deep Dive Views (Critical Design Constraint)

When a user clicks “Go deeper” on Trend, Momentum, or Stretch:

Guiding Principle

These are conceptual charts, not trading charts.

They must:

Show shape, direction, and alignment

Avoid exact values, timestamps, or noisy details

Be visually calm and intuitive

If a smart non-trader can’t describe what’s happening at a glance, the chart is too complex.

Trend Deep Dive: Structure Chart

Purpose: Show market structure, not price precision.

Requirements:

Smooth price line or ribbon

Highlight higher highs / lower lows

Optional long-term baseline (e.g. long EMA)

No axis labels

No gridlines

No candlesticks

No volume

The chart should visually answer:

Is structure rising, falling, or flattening?

Momentum Deep Dive: Energy Chart

Purpose: Show pressure, not indicator mechanics.

Requirements:

Single band oscillating around zero

Thickness and color intensity reflect pressure strength

Smooth curves, no histograms

No MACD lines or signal lines

No numeric scale

The chart should visually answer:

Is selling pressure dominant?

Is pressure increasing or fading?

Stretch Deep Dive: Elasticity Chart

Purpose: Show how stretched price is vs equilibrium.

Requirements:

Centerline = equilibrium

Distance from center = stretch

Smooth motion

Color fades as it returns toward equilibrium

No RSI numbers shown

The chart should visually answer:

Is price stretched?

Is tension building or releasing?

Alignment Logic (Backend / Logic Layer)

Each of the three dimensions (Trend, Momentum, Stretch) produces:

A normalized score (e.g. -1 to +1)

A status (Red / Yellow / Green)

These are combined into an overall alignment score, which drives:

The top verdict message

The visual alignment bar (if implemented)

No single indicator should override the others.

Data Sources (Alpha Vantage)

Use Alpha Vantage API for all market data.

Required endpoints:

Daily adjusted price data

Used for:

Price series

EMAs

Structure analysis

Technical Indicators

EMA (short-term and long-term)

MACD (used internally for momentum, not exposed directly)

RSI (used internally for stretch, not exposed directly)

Important Constraints

Raw indicator values must NOT be shown to users

Indicators are inputs to interpretations, not outputs

Cache results to avoid API rate limits

Handle missing or delayed data gracefully

Language & Tone (Very Important)

All copy must:

Be calm

Be patient

Avoid urgency

Avoid trading language

Forbidden words:

Buy

Sell

Entry

Target

Breakout

Signal

Prediction

Preferred language:

“Conditions”

“Alignment”

“Pressure”

“Stabilization”

“Waiting”

“Improving”

Technical Architecture Requirements

Modular components (Timing should be swappable)

No coupling between Timing and Strategy logic

Clear separation:

Data fetching

Interpretation logic

UI rendering

Minimal shared state to reduce merge conflicts

Explicit Non-Goals (Do NOT Build)

No alerts

No notifications

No auto-actions

No price forecasts

No pattern detection (flags, wedges, etc.)

If a feature feels like it would excite a day trader, it should not be built.

Final Check

Before finalizing, validate that:

The Timing stage makes users more patient

The UI feels calmer than a brokerage chart

The visuals explain the idea without teaching TA mechanics

This is not a trading tool.
It is a decision-calming tool.
