Extend our Financial Strength analysis section with a summary scorecard that aggregates the results from all four quadrants into one clear view.

✅ The goal: help users clearly understand how this business scored across key financial dimensions — and whether it meets their bar for moving forward.

Section Requirements:

Signal Score Summary (Top Row)

Text: 📊 Financial Health Score: X out of 4 signals strong

Dynamic — based on the number of “positive” tags selected

Add a thin horizontal progress bar (4 segments) showing the count visually

Signal Breakdown (Card or Table Style)
For each of the 4 signals:

Title (e.g. "Growth Quality")

Tag result (e.g. ✅ Scalable Growth, ⚠️ Moderate Risk, ❌ Weak Margins)

Use color-coded badges for quick readability:

✅ Green = strong signal

⚠️ Yellow = mixed/caution

❌ Red = weak/concerning

You can lay this out as a vertical list or responsive 2-column grid

Verdict Block (below tags)

Generate a plain-English summary based on the score:

4/4 → “Financially strong. Likely a solid foundation for a long-term investment.”

2–3/4 → “Mixed signals. Worth considering with caution or deeper conviction.”

0–1/4 → “Financial picture is weak. Unless you have strong conviction, this may not be the right fit.”

Use soft background box (Tailwind bg-neutral-50, rounded-xl, p-4)

Decision Prompt + Buttons (Final CTA)
Below the verdict, show:

Would you feel confident owning this for the next decade?
[✔️ Add to Plan]  [🚫 Pass with Confidence]


Buttons should be soft-styled, use Tailwind (rounded-lg, hover effects)

Button clicks should trigger simple console.log actions (e.g. console.log("Passed")) for now

Design Requirements:

Use Tailwind CSS only

Style to match rest of the quadrant section — clean, calm, modern

Use light neutral backgrounds, soft shadows, smooth typography

Mobile-friendly: Stack signals vertically on mobile, 2-column on tablet/desktop

All copy and logic should reflect sensible investing principles — high standards, no hype, calm clarity

🎯 This section completes Stage 2 by helping the user make a confident call — move forward, or pass and keep exploring.
