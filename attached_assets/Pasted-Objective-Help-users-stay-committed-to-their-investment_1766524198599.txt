Objective

Help users stay committed to their investment strategy by letting them set up personalized calendar check-ins to revisit their exit plan. These reminders reduce emotional selling and reinforce long-term discipline.

This feature should:

Let users choose which flags they want to monitor

Let them define when to revisit the position

Let them write a message to their future self

Let them add the check-in to their calendar and/or email it to themselves

🔧 What to Build
1. 📌 Contextual Explanation (Top of UI)

Add a short paragraph that frames the purpose and value of this stage:

Every investor eventually hits doubt.
These reminders help you stay grounded when it matters most — with scheduled moments to revisit your exit plan, investment thesis, and peace of mind.
Set them once. Review when it counts. Stay sensible.

2. ✅ Check-In Builder

A stock ticker input (e.g. AAPL)

4 check-in types, each with:

Title + description

Checklist of questions (already provided in current version)

Default time setting (e.g. 1 week from today, 48h post-earnings)

Optional: inline date picker for custom date/time

Check-in types:

Technical Trend Check (Short-Term)

Market Comparison (Mid-Term)

Investment Thesis Review (Long-Term)

Earnings Risk Alert (Event-Based) — placeholder only (no real data yet)

Include a summary panel:

“You’ll receive check-ins for [TICKER] on the following dates:
• Market Comparison → Jan 4
• Investment Thesis → Jan 31
• ...”

3. 💌 Optional Email Field (for Reminder Delivery)

Let users optionally receive the check-in by email.

We’ll send your check-in plan so you have it when it matters.
