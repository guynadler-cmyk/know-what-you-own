“Add an AI-powered investing section to our existing Restnvest landing page”

We have an existing landing page for Restnvest with sections like:

Hero ("Sensible investing beats optimal")

Problem (built-for-theory vs. built-for-humans)

5-step process ("Sensible > Optimal")

App screenshots

Who it's for

Final CTA ("Start investing sensibly")

We want to add a new section (just after the 5-step process) that introduces how Restnvest uses AI agents to power the experience.

🛠 Please implement the following:

🔹 Section Title:
Let AI do the hard work. You just follow the plan.

🔹 Subtext:
Restnvest uses a quiet army of AI agents to read filings, summarize earnings calls, and analyze risks — so you get clarity, not chaos.

🔹 Features (4 columns/cards with icons):

[
  {
    "title": "Business insights, simplified",
    "description": "AI reads the filings and earnings calls so you don’t have to."
  },
  {
    "title": "Fair value scoring",
    "description": "Understand if a stock is overvalued, undervalued, or just right."
  },
  {
    "title": "Risk signals",
    "description": "AI surfaces red flags and hidden risks — automatically."
  },
  {
    "title": "Plan-aware alerts",
    "description": "Get nudges based on your goals and rules — not the market’s mood."
  }
]


🔹 Optional visual:
Include an illustration or animation of small AI “agents” working behind the scenes — reading documents, pushing insights into the user’s plan, etc. Use placeholder if no assets.

🔹 Optional UI enhancement:
If feasible, annotate the existing 5-step section with subtle "AI-supported" labels:

Step 1: “(Summarized by AI)”

Step 2: “(Fair value scored)”

Step 5: “(Exit rules monitored)”

🔹 Styling guidance:

Match current font, button style, padding, etc.

Maintain whitespace elegance — keep it light, not overly techy

Use icons or minimal illustrations where possible

💡 Output Expectations:

New section HTML/CSS/JS (depending on stack)

Responsive, mobile-friendly

Reusable component for future tests (can easily A/B test “AI” vs “Structure” angle)
