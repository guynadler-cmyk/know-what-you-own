Build 4 "Coming Soon" screens for the remaining stages of our investing app:

Evaluate the Deal

Plan Your Investment

Make Your Move

Protect What You Own

Each screen should:

💻 STRUCTURE

Header Banner at the top:

Icon (🛠️ or similar)

Text: "Coming Soon – This stage is still under construction. Get early access by joining the waitlist."

Main Section with:

Stage Title (e.g., “Plan Your Investment”)

1-line Hook (bold or headline style)

2–3 sentence summary of why this stage matters (see content below)

Call to Action: "Join the waitlist for early access"

Email input field + Join button (submit to mock endpoint or placeholder for now)

Optional visual indicators:

Subtle “under construction” styling: gray tint, dashed border, or faded visuals

✍️ CONTENT (for each screen)
🔹 Evaluate the Deal

Hook: “📊 Don’t just buy stocks. Understand the deal.”

Summary: “Buying a stock is buying a business. This step helps you figure out: is the price fair? What are you really getting? No jargon. Just practical valuation logic you can actually use.”

CTA: “📥 Want first access when this launches? Join the waitlist below.”

🔹 Plan Your Investment

Hook: “🗺️ No more winging it. Invest with a plan.”

Summary: “What’s your goal? How much should you invest — and when? This step helps you create a calm, intentional strategy that makes emotional blowups less likely.”

CTA: “📥 Coming soon: your personal investing playbook. Join the waitlist to be the first in.”

🔹 Make Your Move

Hook: “🎯 Don’t time the market. Time your move.”

Summary: “Execution isn’t about prediction — it’s about structure. This step guides you through entering with clarity: when, how, and how much. No FOMO, no YOLO, just calm execution.”

CTA: “📥 Be the first to try smarter execution tools. Join the waitlist below.”

🔹 Protect What You Own

Hook: “🛡️ Don’t just buy smart. Hold smart.”

Summary: “Every investor eventually hits doubt. This step gives you the tools to stay steady when it matters — with check-ins, exit rules, and guardrails that protect your peace and your portfolio.”

CTA: “📥 Build resilience into your portfolio. Join the waitlist for early access.”

📦 TECH SPECS

React + TailwindCSS preferred

Make each screen reusable via a single ComingSoonStage component with props:

<ComingSoonStage 
  stageTitle="Plan Your Investment"
  icon="🗺️"
  hook="No more winging it. Invest with a plan."
  summary="What’s your goal? How much should you invest — and when?..."
  cta="Join the waitlist for early access"
/>


Include basic form validation for email

For now, the waitlist button can console.log() the email or submit to a dummy endpoint
