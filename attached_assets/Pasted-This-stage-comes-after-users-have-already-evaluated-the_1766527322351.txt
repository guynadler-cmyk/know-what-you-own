This stage comes after users have already evaluated the business fundamentals (revenue, earnings, debt, cash, ROIC, etc.).
Now we want to help users decide whether the stock itself is sensibly priced right now.

This is not about predicting returns or optimizing — it’s about avoiding obvious valuation mistakes and setting realistic expectations.

🎯 Goal

Build a Sensible Stock Valuation screen that mirrors the structure and visual language of our existing “Understand Performance” stage.

The screen should:

Use 4 valuation lenses

Present each lens with a quadrant-style visual

Give a clear, human explanation

End with a Valuation Score Summary

No market benchmarking is required yet (no S&P 500 comparisons).

🧱 Page Structure
Header

Title: Evaluate the Stock
Subtitle / Context copy:

You’ve seen what the business is. Now let’s look at what you’re paying for.
Sensible investing isn’t about finding the cheapest stock — it’s about knowing whether the price, expectations, and potential returns make sense together.

📊 Valuation Modules (Match Stage 2 Layout)

Each module should have:

A selectable tab/card

A simple 2×2 quadrant visual

Status label (e.g. Sensible, Caution, Risky)

Short explanation in plain language

1️⃣ Price Discipline

Purpose: Avoid buying at extremes without conviction

Key ideas to visualize:

Current price relative to recent highs (52‑week or all‑time)

Entry risk awareness

Quadrant labels (example):

Euphoric High

Conviction Buy

Discounted Entry

Falling Knife

Example explanation text:

The stock is trading near its highs. That’s not automatically bad — but it requires strong conviction and a long-term mindset.

2️⃣ Valuation Context

Purpose: Think twice about historically high multiples

Key ideas:

Current valuation vs its own historical range

No peer or market comparisons required yet

Metrics (placeholders OK):

P/E, EV/EBIT, EV/Sales, or FCF Yield

Historical percentile (e.g. “High vs past norms”)

Quadrant labels:

Priced for Perfection

Fair Value

Cheap for a Reason

Undervalued Opportunity

Example explanation:

The stock is trading at elevated multiples compared to its own history. Future growth needs to justify today’s price.

3️⃣ Capital Discipline (Reinvestment + Shareholder Treatment)

Purpose: Reward companies that compound value per share

Key ideas:

ROIC (or ROE if needed)

Share dilution vs buybacks

Capital efficiency

Axes suggestion:

Y‑axis: Return on Invested Capital

X‑axis: Share count trend (dilution → buybacks)

Quadrant labels:

Value Creator

Stable Operator

Growth at All Costs

Value Destroyer

Example explanation:

The company has diluted shareholders over time. Make sure capital raised has translated into durable growth.

4️⃣ Doubling Potential

Purpose: Focus on realistic compounding

Key ideas:

Can this stock plausibly double within ~7 years?

Based on market cap and growth assumptions

Use Rule of 72 logic (no forecasting engine required)

Quadrant labels:

Realistic Compounder

Breakout Potential

Too Slow to Matter

Pipe Dream

Example explanation:

At current growth rates, this business could double in roughly 6–7 years — a reasonable compounding profile if execution holds.

🧮 Valuation Summary Section (Bottom)

Mirror the Financial Health Score pattern from Stage 2.

Example:

Valuation Score: 3 of 4 signals sensible

Show each module with:

Status badge (Sensible / Caution / Risky)

Short label

Final summary message example:

Mixed signals. The valuation looks reasonable, but expectations matter. Worth considering with patience and conviction.

🎨 Design & UX Notes

Match typography, spacing, and card styles from Understand Performance

Keep explanations short, human, and non-technical

Avoid numeric precision — this is about judgment, not optimization

No buy/sell recommendations

🧪 Scope Notes

Placeholder or mocked data is fine

Focus on structure, clarity, and flow

Logic can be static or simplified for now

This is a foundation for deeper valuation tooling later

If anything is unclear, prioritize clarity over complexity.
This screen should help users say: “I understand what I’m paying for — and whether I’m comfortable with it.”
