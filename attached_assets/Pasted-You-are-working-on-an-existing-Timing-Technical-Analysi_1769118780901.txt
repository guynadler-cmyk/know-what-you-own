You are working on an existing Timing (Technical Analysis) implementation in the restnvest app.

⚠️ This is an edit, not a rebuild.
Do NOT refactor architecture, APIs, routing, or data sources.

The alignment bar is correct and should remain unchanged.

Your task is to fix the charts, which currently look polished but fail to clearly communicate what the user should notice.

Core Product Rule (Non-Negotiable)

We do not show information. We drive action.
Charts must visually encode the conclusion so users immediately know what to look for.

If a chart requires the caption to understand what matters, the chart is wrong.

Scenario-Agnostic Requirement

All visuals must work correctly across all market states, including:

Strengthening

Weakening

Sideways

Transitional

Indecisive

Do NOT hard-code annotations for a specific case (e.g. “lower lows”).
The geometry must adapt automatically to the data.

GLOBAL CHART RULES (Apply to All)

One chart = one conclusion

No legends

No instructional text inside charts

No reliance on color alone to convey meaning

Geometry (direction, distance, shape) must carry the message

If the chart can’t be understood with text hidden → simplify further

TREND CHART — Encode Price Structure Explicitly
Question this chart answers

“Is price structure stepping up, stepping down, or unresolved?”

Required visual encoding

The chart MUST:

Explicitly mark swing highs and swing lows

Make the direction of those swings unmistakable

Encode structure through shape, not explanation

Visual rules

Single smooth price line or ribbon

Dots ONLY at detected swing highs and swing lows

Optional faint guide lines connecting highs and lows to show direction

No EMAs

No gradients

No captions inside the chart

No axes, dates, or numbers

A user must instantly be able to say:

“Highs are getting lower”

“Lows are rising”

“Structure is flat / unresolved”

without reading any text.

MOMENTUM CHART — Use EMA Relationship (Not MACD Histogram)
Question this chart answers

“Is short-term behavior diverging from or re-aligning with long-term behavior?”

Required data primitive

Short EMA vs Long EMA

MACD histogram may be used internally for logic, but must not be visualized.

Visual encoding rules

Visualize ONLY the distance between short EMA and long EMA

Centerline = long-term baseline

Distance from center = pressure

Above vs below = polarity

Increasing distance = pressure intensifying

Decreasing distance = pressure easing

Do NOT include:

MACD histogram bars

Signal lines

Multiple curves

Bars + lines together

A user must immediately see:

“Pressure is pulling away downward”

“Pressure is compressing”

“No clear pressure / indecision”

STRETCH CHART — Encode Distance From Equilibrium
Question this chart answers

“How far is price from balance — and is tension building or releasing?”

Required visual encoding

Equilibrium must be visually dominant

Distance from equilibrium must be immediately visible

Movement is secondary to distance

Visual rules

One strong equilibrium line or band

Thin price line

Shade ONLY the gap between price and equilibrium

No RSI values

No overbought / oversold zones

No decorative gradients unrelated to distance

A user must immediately feel:

“Near balance”

or “Meaningfully stretched”

without reading the caption.

WHAT NOT TO CHANGE

Do NOT change data sources or APIs

Do NOT add indicators

Do NOT add numbers, axes, or timestamps

Do NOT refactor component structure

Do NOT introduce trading language or signals

This is a visual communication correction, not a technical expansion.

FINAL VALIDATION CHECK

Before marking complete:

Hide all explanatory text — does each chart still communicate its takeaway?

Can a non-technical investor describe what they’re seeing in one sentence?

Do the charts reduce decision anxiety rather than increase it?

If not, remove visual elements until they do.

Goal:
Charts that make the correct behavior obvious, without asking the user to think like a trader.
