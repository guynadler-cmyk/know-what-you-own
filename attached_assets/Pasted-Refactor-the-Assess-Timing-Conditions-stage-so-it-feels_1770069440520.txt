Refactor the Assess Timing Conditions stage so it feels identical in structure and mental model to the Valuation/Performance sections:

The user selects Trend / Momentum / Stretch via horizontal tiles (no vertical scrolling between them).

Each metric renders in a consistent two-panel layout:

Left: small visual (quadrant)

Right: title + status pill + chips + short summary + “Why this matters” + optional “Go deeper”

Add a Timeframe toggle: Weekly (default) and Daily (optional).

Fix the Stretch module (currently confusing) by restoring the quadrant and using investor-native language.

Non-negotiables

Do not use the word “Zone.”

Use “Overbought” and “Oversold.”

Stretch must use a quadrant (same visual grammar as Trend & Momentum).

The summary must always logically follow the chips. No contradictions.

1) Timeframe Toggle (Weekly default, Daily optional)
UX placement

At the top of “Assess Timing Conditions” (near Guided View toggle), add:

Timeframe: Weekly | Daily (segmented control)

Helper copy under it (small, subtle):

Weekly (default): “Smoother, less noise — better for investing decisions.”

Daily (optional): “More reactive — useful if you want earlier signals.”

Behavior

Default selection: Weekly

Store selection in localStorage (since no user accounts).

When timeframe changes:

Re-fetch / recompute indicators using the chosen resolution

Recompute chips + quadrant position + summary copy

Keep the rest of the UI unchanged (no layout shift)

Data rules

Weekly uses weekly candle series / weekly indicator endpoints (or weekly aggregation if API requires).

Daily uses daily candle series / daily indicator endpoints.

Ensure the label “Weekly” vs “Daily” is visible somewhere in the module so users can reconcile with TradingView/broker views.

2) Navigation Pattern (match Valuation/Performance)
Replace vertical scrolling across Trend/Momentum/Stretch

Currently the TA section can become “stacked cards” or scroll-y.

Refactor so it matches the established pattern:

A row of 3 selection tiles: Trend, Momentum, Stretch

Each tile shows:

Title

One-line status label (e.g., “Weakening structure”, “Pressure building”, “Overbought cooling”)

2–3 mini chips (compact)

Clicking a tile updates the main panel below.

Main panel layout (consistent)

Below tiles, render ONE selected module at a time:

Left: quadrant visual

Right: explanation panel

3) Trend Module (keep as-is, ensure chip → summary consistency)

Trend is already working well conceptually. Keep the same quadrant and chips, but enforce:

Chip-to-summary rule

The summary sentence must be generated from the chip states using a deterministic mapping (not hardcoded phrases that can conflict).

Example: if chips indicate both “Highs: Weakening” and “Lows: Weakening,” summary must be “Structure weakening / under pressure,” not something optimistic.

4) Momentum Module (MACD) — fix wording mismatch

The user feedback: chips can be correct, but the summary text sometimes says the opposite (“intensifying” vs “easing”).

Required structure

Momentum should remain:

Chips:

Short-term pressure (based on MACD histogram direction / momentum)

Long-term baseline (MACD line vs signal / or MACD vs 0 — whichever current logic uses)

Pressure gap (widening vs narrowing)

Fix: deterministic mapping

Write the summary to match chips exactly:

If short-term = weakening, long-term = weakening, gap = widening
→ Summary must clearly communicate pressure building / downside momentum strengthening.

If short-term = weakening, long-term = weakening, gap = narrowing
→ Summary must communicate pressure still negative, but easing / early stabilization (NOT “intensifying”).

If short-term = improving while long-term = weakening
→ “Early recovery / counter-trend bounce risk” (cautious language).

If both improving and gap narrowing
→ “Momentum aligning / improving support.”

Make “Pressure building / Early recovery / Aligned” outcomes strictly derived from those states.

5) Stretch Module — revert to quadrant + investor-native language
The problem to fix

Stretch became unreadable because we introduced abstract “zone/direction” language and dropped the consistent quadrant grammar.

The new Stretch definition (simple + intuitive)

Stretch answers:
“Is price stretched (overbought/oversold), and is that stretch getting worse or starting to unwind?”

Visual must be a quadrant

Use a 2x2 quadrant, same styling as other modules.

Axes (plain English)

X-axis: RSI Level

Left side: Oversold

Middle boundary area: Neutral

Right side: Overbought

(You can keep the 2x2 visual while still labeling ends Oversold/Overbought; Neutral can be implied around the center line.)

Y-axis: RSI Direction

Top: Cooling (RSI falling)

Bottom: Heating (RSI rising)

Note: We are NOT teaching RSI. We’re translating it into “stretched + getting hotter/colder.”

Chips (replace “Zone” with investor-native chips)

Chips must be:

RSI: Oversold | Neutral | Overbought

RSI trend: Rising | Falling | Flat

Optional third chip if useful: Intensity: Mild | Elevated (derived from distance to 30/70, but keep it simple)

Quadrant labels (must be intuitive)

Label the 4 areas with action-oriented language:

Oversold + Rising → “Rebound setup” (potential support forming)

Oversold + Falling → “Still falling” (don’t front-run)

Overbought + Rising → “Overheating” (risk rising)

Overbought + Falling → “Cooling off” (profit-taking risk easing)

Neutral states should map to “Balanced” variants:

Neutral + Rising → “Building strength”

Neutral + Falling → “Softening”

(If you must keep only 4 labels for strict 2x2, then treat Neutral as “near balance” and show it via dot position + chips.)

Summary copy (investor meaning, not RSI theory)

The summary should tie to typical investor actions:

If Oversold:

If rising: “Oversold and improving — early signs of support. Watch for confirmation.”

If falling: “Oversold but still weakening — avoid rushing in.”

If Overbought:

If rising: “Overbought and still heating — risk of pullback rising.”

If falling: “Overbought and cooling — pullback risk easing; consider trimming if you’re up.”

If Neutral:

Rising: “Not stretched — strength building.”

Falling: “Not stretched — but conditions softening.”

Keep “Go deeper” but don’t overload

When Guided View is ON, “How to read this” must be 2–3 lines max, not a block.
Example:

“Overbought/oversold shows how stretched price is.”

“Rising/falling shows whether pressure is building or easing.”

“This helps decide patience vs action.”

6) Guided View behavior (important)

Guided View should add clarity to visuals, not remove the question prompt or hide content.

When Guided View is ON:

show the short “How to read this” microcopy

show subtle tooltips on quadrant labels / dot if needed

When Guided View is OFF:

hide the “How to read this” box and tooltips

keep the core visual + chips + summary

Persist Guided View toggle in localStorage.

7) Acceptance Tests (Replit must verify)

Use ticker AI example + random tickers.

Switching Weekly ↔ Daily changes results (sometimes noticeably).

Stretch always uses:

overbought/oversold language

quadrant visual

chips that match the dot and summary

MACD chips never produce a contradictory summary:

“gap narrowing” can’t yield “conditions intensifying” wording.

Layout matches Valuation/Performance pattern:

tile selection row

one main module visible at a time

no vertical scroll stack for the three TA metrics
