You are editing an existing Timing (Technical Analysis) section in the restnvest app.

⚠️ This is an incremental refactor, not a rebuild.
Routing, APIs, alignment logic, and verdict text must remain unchanged.

The current implementation uses time-series charts that technically work but fail to communicate judgment clearly.

Your task is to replace these charts with simpler, judgment-first visual objects.

Core Principle (Non-Negotiable)

We do not show market information.
We show market conditions.

Users should not interpret charts.
They should recognize states.

No trading language.
No signals.
No entries.

1. Trend — Replace Price Chart with Structural Fingerprint
Goal

Allow users to instantly perceive whether structure is:

up

down

unresolved

Implementation

Remove the continuous price line and pivot plot

Replace with two vertical sequences:

Structural highs

Structural lows

Show only globally significant pivots (noise filtered)

Do NOT treat the latest data point as a confirmed pivot

No time axis, no price axis

Visual constraints

Minimal marks

No connecting lines

Calm, neutral colors

Optional small label: “Structure view (~6 months)”

2. Momentum — Replace Waveform with Relationship Diagram
Goal

Let users see whether:

short-term behavior is forcing change, or

long-term behavior is absorbing pressure

Implementation

Remove the waveform / histogram style chart

Represent momentum as a relationship between:

a stable long-term reference

a mobile short-term reference

Show separation and direction of pull

Optional subtle animation to suggest direction

Constraints

No oscillation

No history

No curves

No snapping to “now”

3. Stretch — Replace RSI Chart with Balance Gauge
Goal

Let users instantly see:

how far from balance price is

whether it’s moving further away or returning

Implementation

Remove historical line chart

Show:

a central balance zone

a single current-state marker

a faint directional hint (arrow or gradient)

Constraints

No thresholds

No numeric values

No “oversold/overbought”

4. Animation & Tone

All transitions should be smooth and calming (300–500ms)

Use fades, gentle motion

Avoid sharp or attention-grabbing effects

This section should feel observational, not reactive.

Final Check

Before marking complete, confirm:

Each visual answers its question in <1 second

No chart requires interpretation

The section feels calmer and clearer than before

Nothing implies action or prediction
