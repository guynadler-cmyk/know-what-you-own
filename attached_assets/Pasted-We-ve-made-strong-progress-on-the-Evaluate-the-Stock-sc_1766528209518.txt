We’ve made strong progress on the Evaluate the Stock screen — now it’s time to clean up some critical UX details to match restnvest’s core philosophy: Sensible, Human, Understandable.

Please implement the following refinements:

1. 🟢🟡🔴 Tag Colors = Clear Value Judgments Only

Right now, tags like 52-Week High or Market Cap are shown in green, which implies “good” — even though they’re just context.

Update logic so:

Green = desirable investor signal (e.g., high earnings yield, reasonable valuation)

Red = fragile or expensive

Yellow = caution / mixed

Neutral (gray or light blue) = context-only (no inherent judgment)

2. 🏷 Tag Label Updates

Here’s a table of specific replacements:

Current Tag	Change To	Color	Tooltip Text
52-Week High	Distance from Recent High	Neutral	“How far the current price is from the stock’s recent peak”
Market Cap	Company Size	Neutral	“The total value of the company in the stock market”
P/E ↑ (green)	Valuation Rising	Red	“The stock is getting more expensive relative to earnings”
Historical Multiples ↓	Cheaper vs History	Green	“The stock is trading cheaper than usual based on past metrics”
Rule of 72	Replace with → Time to Double: Xy	Neutral	“Rough estimate of how long the company might take to double in size”
ROIC	Keep, but add hover:	Green/Red/Yell	“How much return the company earns on reinvested money”
Share Dilution	Keep, add hover:	Red	“If the company is issuing more shares, your ownership gets diluted”

You can add others based on logic already present — just follow the rule:

If it’s neutral data → neutral color.
If it’s positive/negative for investors → color accordingly.

3. 🧠 Tooltip Standard

All financial terms must include a hover tooltip in plain English.
Avoid formulas or jargon. A user should never wonder “what does this mean?”

4. 🧪 Additional Optional Tweaks (if time)

Consider renaming Valuation Context to Valuation Reality or Valuation Check — to feel more actionable

Highlight one-liner summary text with mild bolding or tint, e.g.,
“This price seems reasonable given the company’s recent performance.”

🧭 Overall Goal
