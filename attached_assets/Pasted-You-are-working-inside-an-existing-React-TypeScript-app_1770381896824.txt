You are working inside an existing React + TypeScript app (restnvest / Know What You Own). Refine the existing Strategy stage UI to feel more premium (“expensive”), reduce scrolling, and improve planning interactions—without changing any research outputs or giving recommendations.

Core rules

Do not modify analysis results or recompute fundamentals/valuation/timing.

Do not give investment advice (“buy/sell/hold”, “consider waiting”, “better entry point”). Strategy is user-authored planning only.

All computed values are arithmetic based on user inputs.

Keep it fast: minimal fields, minimal friction, minimal scroll.

Changes to implement
1) Takeaways expanded by default (no one should miss them)

The Read-only takeaways from prior stages section must be expanded on initial load (defaultOpen / defaultValue). Add subtle helper text: “Click any takeaway to view details.”

2) Layout: Premium Option B + reduce scrolling

Implement Option B: two-column layout and aim to keep most content above the fold on standard laptop screens.

Layout spec

Use a single centered container (consistent width) for everything: max-w-5xl (or similar).

Structure:

Top (full width): Read-only takeaways (expanded), but compact (tight spacing, 1–2 lines each).

Main (2 columns):

Left column: Conviction slider + Amount input + “I’m wrong if…” builder

Right column: Plan preview (tranches), with editable amounts + reset controls

Bottom (full width): Save + Email buttons row

Reduce scrolling tactics

Keep takeaway cards compact (truncate to 1–2 lines with “View details” link).

Keep tranche cards compact (no oversized padding).

Use responsive behavior:

On desktop: 2 columns

On mobile: stack (fine if mobile scrolls more)

Avoid large vertical whitespace between sections.

3) Conviction → Non-linear tranche sizing (not equal split)

Replace equal tranche splits with weight-based allocations by conviction tier:

Exploring (5 tranches) weights: [0.12, 0.18, 0.20, 0.25, 0.25]

Interested (3 tranches) weights: [0.35, 0.33, 0.32]

High conviction (2 tranches) weights: [0.60, 0.40]

Allocate rounding remainder to tranche 1 (or last—pick one and be consistent).

Important: This is a deterministic transformation of user choices (not advice).

4) Amount formatting (10,000)

Format the amount input using Intl.NumberFormat("en-US") so it displays 10,000.

Accept raw digit typing; sanitize non-digits.

Store numeric value in state; render formatted value in UI.

Default remains 10000 if empty.

5) Manual overwrite tranche amounts + Reset

Each tranche card must support:

Editable amount input (currency formatted)

“Auto/Manual” lock icon behavior:

If user edits, mark tranche as Manual

Auto tranches recalc when conviction/total changes

Manual tranches keep their value unless user resets

Add controls above Plan Preview:

Reset to auto-split (restores weights-based allocations)

Even split (optional but nice)

Show “Remaining” or “Over by” if tranche sum differs from total

Add “Fix” button to adjust the last tranche to make totals match.

6) Takeaway cards link back to stage details

Each takeaway card must include a “View details →” link that navigates the user back to the relevant stage:

Performance → Understand Performance stage

Valuation → Evaluate the Stock stage

Timing → Timing stage (wherever it lives)

Use existing navigation patterns (route param or scroll anchor). Preserve Strategy state so user can return without losing edits.

Also remove recommendation-y wording from displayed takeaways where possible (avoid “consider waiting”, etc.). Rephrase to neutral context if the app currently generates advice-like sentences.

7) Make “I’m wrong if…” easier (Guided builder)

Replace the plain textarea with a guided statement builder:

3 groups of selectable chips:

Area: Revenue, Margins, Debt, Cash flow, Competition, Strategy narrative, Management execution

Change: stalls, declines, rises, deteriorates, compresses, breaks

Time/threshold: “for 2+ quarters”, “by >10%”, “without recovery”, “below prior level”

Flow:

User selects one from each group → preview sentence

Button: Add statement

Statements appear in a list below (delete + reorder via up/down buttons; drag-and-drop optional)

Auto-generate the final combined output string (still editable in a small textarea below the builder)

Saved/emailed value should be the final combined string.

Deliverables

Updated Strategy page with premium 2-column layout, reduced scroll, expanded takeaways.

Weight-based tranches with manual overrides + reset.

Proper amount formatting.

Stage detail links from takeaways.

Guided “I’m wrong if…” builder.

Do UI changes first, then wire state logic, then ensure save/email payload includes:

conviction value + label

total amount

tranches (amount + trigger + manual/auto flag)

“I’m wrong if…” final output

read-only snapshot/takeaway texts (as displayed)

No recommendations. No analysis changes.
